# üîç Explainable AI Matching Feature

## Overview

The Explainable AI Matching feature provides **phrase-level analysis** with detailed justifications for why a candidate received their match score. This transforms the black-box AI matching into a transparent, trust-building tool that helps candidates understand exactly what helped or hurt their application.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Phrase-Level Analysis**
- Identifies specific phrases in the resume that impact the match score
- Assigns weights from -10 to +10 for each phrase
- Provides detailed justifications for each weight

### 2. **Interactive Resume Highlighting**
- **Green highlights**: Strong positive matches
- **Yellow highlights**: Neutral/minimal impact
- **Red highlights**: Negative mismatches (with strikethrough)
- **Hover tooltips**: Show AI justifications for each highlighted phrase

### 3. **Structured JSON Output**
```json
{
  "match_score": 85,
  "explanations": [
    {
      "phrase": "Led development team of 5 engineers",
      "weight": 8,
      "justification": "Strong leadership experience aligns with team lead requirements",
      "category": "positive",
      "resume_section": "experience"
    },
    {
      "phrase": "Basic knowledge of Python",

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. **ExplainableAIMatcher Class**
```python
class ExplainableAIMatcher:
    def match_with_explanations(self, resume_text: str, job_description: str) -> ExplainableMatchResult
    def create_explainable_prompt(self, resume_text: str, job_description: str) -> str
    def parse_ai_response(self, response: str) -> Optional[ExplainableMatchResult]
    def highlight_resume_text(self, resume_text: str, explanations: List[PhraseExplanation]) -> str
```

#### 2. **Data Structures**
```python
@dataclass
class PhraseExplanation:
    phrase: str
    weight: int  # -10 to +10
    justification: str
    category: str  # 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral'
    resume_section: str  # 'experience', 'skills', 'education', etc.

@dataclass
class ExplainableMatchResult:
    match_score: int  # 0-100
    explanations: List[PhraseExplanation]
    summary: str
    strengths: List[str]
    weaknesses: List[str]
    suggestions: List[str]
```

#### 3. **ResumeHighlighter Class**
```python
class ResumeHighlighter:
    @staticmethod
    def create_highlight_css() -> str
    @staticmethod
    def display_explanations(explanations: List[PhraseExplanation]) -> None
```

### AI Prompt Engineering

The system uses carefully crafted prompts to ensure:
- **Consistent JSON output** with proper structure
- **Specific justifications** for each weight assignment
- **Actionable feedback** for improvement
- **Balanced analysis** covering both strengths and weaknesses

### Error Handling

- **JSON parsing**: Robust handling of malformed AI responses
- **Fallback analysis**: Rule-based matching when AI is unavailable
- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields are present
- **Retry logic**: Multiple attempts for API calls

## üìä Weight Assignment Guidelines

### Positive Weights (+1 to +10)
- **+10 to +7**: Strong positive match (exact skill match, leadership experience)
- **+6 to +3**: Moderate positive match (relevant experience, good skills)
- **+2 to +1**: Minor positive match (basic alignment)

### Neutral Weights (0)
- Generic statements with minimal impact
- Standard qualifications that don't significantly help or hurt

### Negative Weights (-1 to -10)
- **-1 to -3**: Minor negative mismatch (vague descriptions)
- **-4 to -6**: Moderate negative mismatch (missing important skills)
- **-7 to -10**: Strong negative mismatch (irrelevant or outdated skills)

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

### 1. **Weight Normalization**
- Convert raw weights to percentage contributions
- Make weights comparable across different analyses

### 2. **Customizable Scoring**
- Allow recruiters to adjust weight importance
- Prioritize specific skills or experience types

### 3. **Advanced Highlighting**
